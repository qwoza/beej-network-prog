192.0.2.12 - could say that the first 3 bytes are the network
	     and the last byte was the host.
	     e.g. we're talking about host 12 on the network 192.0.2.0

There WERE classes of subnets:
	first one, two, or three bytes of addr was the network part
	for example, in a CLASS A NETWORK, if you had:
		One byte for the network part
		Three bytes for the host part
		You could have:
			24 bits-worth of hosts on your network (16 million or so actual hosts)

	opposite end: CLASS C NETWORK (3 bytes net, 1 byte host, 256 hosts, minus a few that were reserved)


NETMASK:
	network portion of the ip is described by something called the NETMASK
	
	You BITWISE-AND the NETMASK with the IP ADDRESS to get the NETWORK NUMBER out of it.
	
	(e.g. netmask = 255.255.255.0, ip = 192.0.2.12, then:
	      YOUR NETWORK = (192.0.2.12 AND 255.255.255.0) = 192.0.2.0)

Unfortunately, it turned out that this wasn’t fine-grained enough for the eventual
needs of the Internet; we were running out of Class C networks quite quickly, and
we were most definitely out of Class As, so don’t even bother to ask. To remedy this,
The Powers That Be allowed for the netmask to be an arbitrary number of bits, not just 
8, 16, or 24. So you might have a netmask of, say 255.255.255.252, which is 30 bits of
network, and 2 bits of host allowing for four hosts on the network.
(Note that the netmask is ALWAYS a bunch of 1-bits followed by a bunch of 0-bits.)

HOWEVER it's a little unwieldy to use such big strings of numbers:
NEW STYLE came along (it's way nicer)
You just:
	put a slash after the IP addr and then follow that by the NUMBER OF NETWORK BITS in DECIMAL
	Like this: 192.0.2.12/30

Or, for IPv6, something like this: 2001:db8::/32 or 2001:db8:5413:4028::9db9/64.
