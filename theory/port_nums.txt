Another address is used by TCP AND UDP (aside from IP).
It is the PORT NUMBER.

PORT NUM = 16 BIT NUM which is like the LOCAL ADDRESS FOR THE CONNECTION

Think of it like so:
	IP = address of a hotel
	Port = room number

Suppose you want a computer that handles incoming mail AND web services
	how do you differentiate between the two on a computer with a single IP?
	Ports!

Different services on the internet have different well-known port numbers

or in /etc/services (if on nix)

http = 80
telnet = 23
smtp = 25

ports < 1024 are often considered special and usually require special os privs to use.
